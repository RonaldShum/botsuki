      Your mind is so full of troubles and fears
      That diminished your wonder over the years
      But today I have a special place
      A beach for us to go.

      A shore reaching beyond your sight
      A sea that sparkles with brilliant light
      The walls in your mind will melt away
      Before the sunny glow.

      I'll be the beach that washes your worries away
      I'll be the beach that you daydream about each day
      I'll be the beach that makes your heart leap
      In a way you thought had left you long ago.

      Let's bury your heavy thoughts in a pile of sand
      Bathe in sunbeams and hold my hand
      Wash your insecurities in the salty sea
      And let me see you shine.

      Let's leave your memories in a footprint trail
      Set you free in my windy sail
      And remember the reasons you're wonderful
      When you press your lips to mine.

      I'll be the beach that washes your worries away
      I'll be the beach that you daydream about each day
      I'll be the beach that makes your heart leap
      In a way you thought had left you long ago.

      But if you let me by your side
      Your own beach, your own escape
      You'll learn to love yourself again.

      You know what I heard about Amy?
      Amy likes spiders.
      Icky, wriggly, hairy, ugly spiders!
      That's why I'm not friends with her.

      Amy has a cute singing voice.
      I heard her singing my favorite love song.
      Every time she sang the chorus, my heart would pound to the rhythm of the words.
      But she likes spiders.
      That's why I'm not friends with her.

      One time, I hurt my leg really bad.
      Amy helped me up and took me to the nurse.
      I tried not to let her touch me.
      She likes spiders, so her hands are probably gross.
      That's why I'm not friends with her.

      Amy has a lot of friends.
      I always see her talking to people.
      She probably talks about spiders.
      What if her friends start to like spiders too?
      That's why I'm not friends with her.

      It doesn't matter if she has other hobbies.
      It doesn't matter if she keeps it private.
      It doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt anyone.

      It's gross.
      She's gross.
      The world is better off without spider lovers.

      And I'm gonna tell everyone.

      Tomorrow will be brighter with me around
      But when today is dim, I can only look down.
      My looking is a little more forward
      Because you look at me.

      When I want to say something, I say it with a shout!
      But my truest feelings can never come out.
      My words are a little less empty
      Because you listen to me.

      When something is above me, I reach for the stars.
      But when I feel small, I don't get very far.
      My standing is a little bit taller
      Because you sit with me.

      I believe in myself with all of my heart.
      But what do I do when it's torn all apart?
      My faith is a little bit stronger
      Because you trusted me.

      My pen always puts my feelings to the test.
      I'm not a good writer, but my best is my best.
      My poems are a little bit dearer
      Because you think of me.

      Because you, because you, because you.
